In [Trust: the inside story of the rise and fall of Ethereum ](https://aeon.co/essays/trust-the-inside-story-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-ethereum), I read

> Finally, we shouldn’t deceive ourselves with the idea that a technological fix can replace the human dimension of trust. Automation of trust is illusory. Rather than disparaging and cloaking human trust, we should face the brutal truth: we can’t escape the need to rely on other people, as fallible and imperfect as they might be. We need to nurture and nourish trust – not throw it away, like so much debased and worthless currency.
