In [There's Just No Getting around It: You're Building a Distributed System - ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856), I read a grounded perspective of the hazards of just "going to the cloud"...

> In many cases, these applications have been running on single-purpose systems in isolated or low-utilization environments. Simply dropping them into an environment that is often saturated induces failure more often than they have ever seen or were designed for. In these cases, the dirty secret is that applications must be rewritten when moving to cloud environments; to design around the environment in which an application will be running requires that it be built as a distributed system.
