I recently completed reading [Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SI0B6PC/ref=r_soa_w_d), by Sherry Turkle. Sherry's position is that the classic, face-to-face **conversation** is critical to our personal development and communication, but we are dangerously close to abandoning conversation for the lure of digital efficiency and control.

Some sections which particularly resonated with me:

# Family development
Regarding teaching children by means of digital simulations:
> Time in simulation gets children ready for more time in simulation. Time with people teaches children how to be in a relationship, beginning with the ability to have a conversation.

The unexpected benefits of face-to-face conversation:
> Most endangered: the kind in which you listen intently to another person and expect that he or she is listening to you; where a discussion can go off on a tangent and circle back; where something unexpected can be discovered about a person or an idea.

Teaching children about solitude (being comfortable with their own company, self-reflection):
> And if we don’t teach our children to be alone, they will only know how to be lonely.

On our job as parents (and the behaviours we model):
> ...he takes the long view: “I’m not raising the children. I’m raising the grown-ups that they’re going to be.”... In every culture, young children want the objects of grown-up desire....

On how boredom is a part of healthy development of children:
> I said that we use digital “passbacks” to placate young children who say they are bored. We are not teaching them that boredom can be recognized as your imagination calling you.

On how parents can "bless" their children with their attention:
> To give children these rewards, adults have to show up, put their phones away, look at children, and listen. And then, repeat.

How to teach children solitude:
> Remember that we teach the capacity for solitude by being quiet alongside children who have our attention

Don't bring your phones to the dinner table, parents:
> Given this, it doesn’t make sense to bring a phone to dinner with your children. Accept your vulnerability. Remove the temptation.

A parent's presence changes a child's emergency into a learning experience:
> A child alone with a problem has an emergency. A child in conversation with a grown-up is facing a moment in life and learning how to cope with it.

Using location-tracking apps may make it easier to know who's home or not, but it removes the personal connection which powers the relationship in the first place:
> Margot is getting what she wants without conversation. But she is giving up a lot. In her family, location dots are calming. There is now no need—and no obvious opportunity—to have difficult conversations about responsibility and trust. Instead of talking, you agree to surveillance.

How we allow our devices to make our relationships shallow, to isolate us from each other:
> The irony is that if Alli and her family were separated by distance, if her mother had to work in a different city, they might well be using apps on their phones and computers to bring them together. Dinner might be a time to Skype. Families use social media to keep everyone informed of big events and milestones. But living together, the members of Alli’s family let their devices isolate them.

# Personal development
The limitations of web-surfing as a means of unwinding or relaxing:
> We have convinced ourselves that surfing the web is the same as daydreaming. That it provides the same space for self-reflection. It doesn’t.

On how we sabotage ourselves by cannibalizing our "spare" time:
> We deny ourselves the benefits of solitude because we see the time it requires as a resource to exploit.

Why we like to apologize via text or email:
> It has always been hard to sit down and say you’re sorry when you’ve made a mistake... <snip> A face-to-face apology is an occasion to practice empathic skills.

On the value of "pushing through" the boring parts of a conversation rather than tuning out or turning to your phone:
> In work, love, and friendship, relationships of mutuality depend on listening to what might be boring to you but is of interest to someone else.

The trap of the "sharing" generation:
> If we don’t know who we are when we are alone, we turn to other people to support our sense of self.

The trap of assuming everything offered by technology is better, or a fix to a problem:
> Just because technology can help us solve a “problem” doesn’t mean it was a problem in the first place.

Our reliance on outside tools and systems to find what we need, when we need it, diminishes our capacity for internalizing knowledge and skills:
> But they continue to skip what this teacher calls “basic content,” thinking that this is something the web will fill them in on—someday. The web is their “information prosthetic” and they see no cost to having one.

Basic reliance on facts is inadequate for deep thinking:
> You need to have a strong background of facts and concepts on board before you know you need them. We think with what we know; we use what we know to ask new questions.

A trend among young doctors to rely heavily on external sources for patient diagnosis:
> But will this “just-in-time” and “just enough” information teach young doctors to organize their own ideas and draw their own conclusions?

We become blind to how our devices are changing us:
> But if we don’t “see” our devices, we are less likely to register the effect they are having on us.

How technology helps us "work" but degrades our capacity for deep thought:
> “The technology makes me more productive, but I know the quality of my thinking suffers.” It’s a telling formulation. What she is saying is that technology makes her feel more productive despite a lower quality of thought.

The downside of always "sharing" your life with friends:
> It means we’ll always choose the movie they’d choose and won’t choose the movie we want to see if they’d make fun of it.

How our life online makes our offline selves "dumber":
> We come to online life with the expectation that we can ask a question and get an almost immediate answer. In order to meet our expectations, we begin to ask simpler questions. We end up dumbing down our communications and this makes it harder to approach complex problems.

We end up treating our fellow humans like a computer or an app:
> Tutored by technology, we become reactive and transactional in our exchanges because this is what technology makes easy.

We diminish our own capacity for reason and argument, and surrender our rights to a considered opinion:
> People don’t want to post opinions on social media that they fear their followers will disagree with.

How to start engaging in real conversation:
> Obey the seven-minute rule. This is the rule, suggested to me by a college junior, that grows out of the observation that it takes at least seven minutes to see how a conversation is going to unfold. The rule is that you have to let it unfold and not go to your phone before those seven minutes pass... Conversation, like life, has silences and boring bits. This bears repeating: It is often in the moments when we stumble and hesitate and fall silent that we reveal ourselves to each other. Digital communication can lead us to an edited life. We should not forget that an unedited life is also worth living.

Our sad reliance on our mobile phones:
> It used to be that we imagined our mobile phones were there so that we could talk to each other. Now we want our mobile phones to talk to us.

# Professional development
Our tendency to choose an inferior tool (text or chat over face-to-face conversation) for a task, because it gives us a feeling of control:
> But what I’ve found is that once people have texting, chat, and email available, they stick with them even when they suspect that these are not the right tools for the job. Why? They are convenient. They make us feel in control.

On privacy and focus in the workplace:
> The top performers “overwhelmingly worked for companies that gave their workers the most privacy, personal space, control over their physical environments, and freedom from interruption.”

On the challenges of managing staff of the "social generation":
> As she talks about them, she is arguably describing the kinds of workers the Holbrooke students will become: These young people are not used to working on their own on a project. In the past, if you think of employees . . . who are now in their forties, fifties, sixties . . . if you gave them a project, they thought it was their job to do it. Alone. Now, people can’t be alone. They need continual contact and support and reinforcement. They want to know they are doing well. Left on their own to do their work, they feel truly bereft. They are always connected to each other online, but as I listen to their supervisors, they also need more support than before. They need a different kind of management.

The pitfalls of multitasking:
> When you train your brain to multitask as your basic approach—when you embrace hyper attention—you won’t be able to focus even when you want to. So, you’re going to have trouble sitting and listening to your children tell you about their day at school. You’re going to have trouble at work sitting in a meeting and listening to your colleagues. Their narrative will seem painfully slow.

Our warped concept of "productivity":
> “We think of productivity as . . . sitting in front of the computer and banging out emails, scheduling things; and that’s what makes us productive. But it’s not.” What makes you productive is “your interactions with other people—you know, you give them new ideas, you get new ideas from them; and . . . if you even make five people a little bit more productive every day, those conversations are worth it.”

The illusion of "real work" (busywork):
> Supported by the impression that this is when they are doing their “real work,” many employees feel justified in avoiding face-to-face conversation. And because they avoid it, they don’t understand what it can accomplish.

How technology gives us the impression of control while diminishing our interpersonal connections:
> Hassoun craves control more than sociability. She will email a “Sorry” instead of delivering a face-to-face apology; at work, as in her personal life, when she faces a difficult conversation, she makes every effort to sidestep it with an email. The difficult, even if necessary, conversations take time she says she doesn’t have. And they demand emotional exposure. Hassoun sees emotional exposure as stress she doesn’t have to subject herself to.

An organization needs to really commit to prioritizing conversation. Lip service to conversation while pressuring for results produces no benefits:
> But it is at HeartTech that I learn the limitations of “build it and they will come.” Despite the right architecture and vision statement, at HeartTech, no one has time for much open-ended conversation—or people don’t believe they have permission to take the time.

The role of senior management in shaping company culture:
> If you think conversation is important for your organization, you can’t just say so or design beautiful kitchens and cafeterias to facilitate it. You have to leave time and space. Most of all, senior management has to model it, leading by daily example. If not, the beautiful spaces simply become amenities. And new employees who start conversations will wonder if they should apologize.

The role of managers in modeling desired behaviour in employees:
> Champion conversation in the day-to-day. The moment needs mentors with humility, acknowledging that just as parents model the behavior (texting during dinner) they then criticize in their children, managers often model the behavior they criticize in their employees.

The tension between engineering problems and interpersonal problems:
> A human resources officer at a high-tech firm tells me: “The catchphrase among my peers is that ‘engineers will not deliver difficult conversations.’”...

The downside of telecommuting / remote work:
> People require eye contact for emotional stability and social fluency. A lack of eye contact is associated with depression, isolation, and the development of antisocial traits such as exhibiting callousness. And the more we develop these psychological problems, the more we shy away from eye contact.

# The illusion of multitasking

How conference calls include an implicit expectation that you'll be multitasking:
> at ReadyLearn, it is assumed that when you are on a conference call, you are available for email and messaging on the side. Increasingly, the assumption of divided attention is also made for in-person meetings, particularly status meetings

The waste of time that multitasking meetings are:
> ‘What’s the point of my even doing anything? No one is listening.’ People are speaking ‘for the record.’” When people speak for the record, they usually don’t listen to what comes before or after. Meetings are performances of what meetings used to be.

The role of senior staff in mentoring the "social generation":
> Mentoring for conversation requires that you address two questions. You will be asked, outright, “Why focus on one thing, as you must in a face-to-face conversation, when you can get greater ‘value’ from spreading around your attention?” The answer: Multitasking will not bring greater value. You will feel you are achieving more and more as you accomplish less and less. You will be asked, outright, “Why go through the anxiety of separating from all of your connections to focus on the small group you are with?” The answer: The more you talk to your colleagues, the greater your productivity.

How we fool ourselves into thinking we are being "effective" multitaskers:
> Multitasking comes with its own high. Our brains crave the fast and unpredictable, the quick hit of the new. We know this is a human vulnerability. Unless we design our lives and technology to work around it, we resign ourselves to diminished performance.

The surprising results of uni-tasking:
> In a world where everyone “knows” that multitasking is bad for you but doesn’t do anything about it, things change if your employer tells you that you are going to be given the time, space, and privacy to begin and complete important tasks one by one.

The benefits of encouraging solitude and uni-tasking:
> But studies show that on average, an office worker is distracted (electronically) every three minutes and that it takes an average of twenty-three minutes to get back on track... Encouraging conversation gives you permission to encourage solitude. Give yourself and others permission to think—sometimes alone—and provide time and space to do so... Good management in the twenty-first century asks us to help our employees learn to tolerate the anxiety of being left alone long enough to think their own thoughts.

A strategy for coping with information-overload:
> So if as a parent or teacher or employer you receive an email request, respond by saying that you need time to think about it. This seems a small thing, but it is too rarely done. A thirty-year-old consultant tells me that in her world, this response would be “age-inappropriate.” This makes me think that it is time to reconsider our sense of the appropriate in every domain.
