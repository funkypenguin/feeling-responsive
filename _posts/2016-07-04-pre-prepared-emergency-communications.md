title: The importance of pre-prepared emergency communications channels
--- 

The post "[What Happened](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/adobe-creative-cloud-update-bug/)" discusses BackBlaze's role in alerting customers (theirs and Adobe's) to a data-deleting bug:

> Side-Note: our lead Mac developer, support team, and I were all working from different locations. The lead Mac developer was working from home, the support team was in the office (some of them were also working remotely) and I was in San Diego at a conference. We used Slack to coordinate and it worked pretty well for a real-time event like this.

What stood out of the technical details here for me is the importance of having pre-existing processes and channels for emergency incident management and collaberation in place, to reduce stress and maximize focus on the issue at hand.
