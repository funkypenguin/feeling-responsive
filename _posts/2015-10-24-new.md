Refreshed to [read][0] that ruthless efficiency and perfectionism (i.e Page, below) is not the only way (compared to Sundar) to captain a tech success

About Page:
> “He could come off as very harsh,” said one person who has had many encounters with Page over the years. “Until you realize it was more that he was completely lacking in EQ. I mean, zero.”

About Sundar:
> The Indian-born executive is often described as possessing both hard and soft skills, equipping him to understand products and manage their maintanence.
