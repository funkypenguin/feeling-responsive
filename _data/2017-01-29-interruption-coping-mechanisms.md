- note about kids and fragmentation
- 
Use systems which give you confidence in halting a task and returning to it without friction. 

Example 1 : Washing the dishes. 

1. The process of completing the task is well-understood (you know up-front what you'll be doing, there's no challenge re **how** to perform the task)
2. The task includes obvious visual cues to indicate outstanding work (dishes on counter vs dishes stacked in dishwasher)
3. The cost of an interruption is small. The individual mini-tasks are so small that they can't be interrupted (pick up mug, put in dishwasher) - Atomic minitasks, or the cost of an interruption is negligible.
4. You could pause the task at any time and return with no negative impact
5. I have a clear internal and external definition of completion "counter is clean and dishwasher is running"

Example 2 : Reading a book

1. I know how to read a book.
2. Progression through the book is visually obvious
3. Being interrupted while reading doesn't cause you to "un-read" what you've just read, and since I __want__ my kids to observe me reading, I don't mind being interrupted.
4. I trust that the book and necessary tools (highlighter, notebook, etc) will be in exactly the same state when I return to them
5. I have a clear definition of completion (I've reached the end of the book)

 Negative example :  

Debugging why the gmvault docker container I use is not working

1. I don't know what's wrong, so I don't know (yet) how I'll fix it or how long it'll take
2. Since I don't know what's wrong, I have no idea how far I am through the process
3. Debugging involves maintaining "state" in your head - competing theories, possible-related information. With no place to store this, an interruption would risk "loosing state", and requiring painful rework.
4. My debugging environment is transient - once I log out, I loose my command history and output.
5. I'm not completely clear on the end state, since I don't know what's possible / not possible with the faulty tool.

So clearly, this is not an interruption-friendly process.
