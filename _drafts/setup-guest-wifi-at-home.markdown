Dear Mom,

You know how you have wifi at home? Your netbook, tablet, and smartphone are always online at home because of it? Your wifi network has a name, like "Linksys" (if you never changed it), "TB3820" (if it was pre-setup by your ISP), or  "GrannyPad" (if you or the installer got smart). All your gadgets connect to your wifi network by name (and the password, which you may or may not know!)

Many wifi routers (the mid to top-level ones) will let you create a _second_ SSID specifically for guests. This ''guest'' network functions just like your ''normal'' network, but with a few important distinctions:

1. Guest networks have a different name (and password) to the normal network
2. Users on the guest network can't access the normal network

If this seems like unnecessary complexity, consider the following typical scenario:

* You have a netbook, a tablet, and a smartphone, and they're often not up-to-date because they're either too old, or they're used too infrequently, or you just don't get around to it.
* Dad has an even older smartphone which doesn't get updated!
* Some of your students come around to work on a sciencey project, and they ask for wifi access for their gadgets.

Now if you decide you want to revoke their access, you can just change the guest password without affecting all of your own devices. (You should probably change this on a periodic basis as a good practice anyway, to ensure that there are no long-term "digital squatters")

## Layers of protection

Benefit #2 (separation of access) becomes apparent as soon as you start using your wifi for things like:

* Playing videos on your TV from smartphones
* Sharing media between your devices

Sometimes you'll want to give guests access to the internet, but not to the same network that all your personal photos, files, and devices are on.
